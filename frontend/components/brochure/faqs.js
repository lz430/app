        content:
            'Simply browse dealer inventory, select equipment that is important to you, and compare multiple brands to find the best deal. Once you land on the right car, review current rebates and calculate your lease or purchase payment using our advanced tools. Avoid salesmanship and pressure at the dealership by doing it all yourself. We even facilitate the financing if needed by using the same finance sources as the dealer and more. Structure your entire deal online and the dealer will draw up your paperwork and deliver your vehicle at the time and place convenient to you.',

Since we don’t work for any one dealer and aren’t working on a commission percentage, we stay unbiased throughout the entire buying process. With Deliver My Ride, nobody sells you a car, you buy the car that’s right for you.',
