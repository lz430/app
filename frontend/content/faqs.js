In order to do so, they price their inventory very competitively, so you can have confidence that you will not overpay. On average, pricing on our site is 13% ($4800) below sticker/MSRP. Besides that, you can compare all the brands in one view instead of bouncing around from website to website. This way you can find savings on a car you may not have originally considered. In addition, what your time is worth? Maybe you can save a couple hundred dollars by driving or calling around to several dealers and fighting it out, but that could take hours and doesn’t guarantee that you won’t pay more once you walk in the dealership.',

So, you may be looking at a deal on March 25<sup>th</sup> and it could be completely different on April 3<sup>rd</sup>. In addition, dealers pay bank interest on their vehicle inventory, so it is too expensive to hold cars for more than a day or two.

However, if you want to test drive a car before you buy, we recommend that you test drive the vehicle of a friend, neighbor, co-worker or family member for the most valuable experience. In these cases, you will likely get more honest feedback and be able to test the car for a few hours instead of a few minutes if done at a dealership. Since the cars we sell are brand new, the quality and condition will not factor into drivability. If you want to drive the dealer’s vehicle, we can facilitate a test drive or you are welcome to visit a local dealer to do so. In this case, we recommend contacting the dealer in advance and schedule a time with a specific person.
